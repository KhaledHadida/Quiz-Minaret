**QuizMinaret** - _"an app to test Muslims & non Muslims knowledge in Islam through various topics"_

**_Little Note_**: This was my first time ever using React Native, and was extremely fun to create, I definitely learned a lot & saw a lot of similarities with React.

Quiz Minaret is a quiz app made for those who are Muslim seeking more knowledge or even those who want to test their knowledge in Islam, the quiz is divided into 3 major sections: Islamic foundation, practices and history and each section includes 100 questions as of now. 

Below are screenshots for the app:
